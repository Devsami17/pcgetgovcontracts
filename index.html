        "I've had an incredible experience working with GCAS and their team. The marketing strategies they've taught me have completely transformed my approach to government contracting. What I appreciate most is how tailored their guidance is to the industry, making it both practical and results-driven. The Clipboard Marketing Program has been a game-changer—innovative, effective, and exactly what I needed to streamline my outreach and close more contractors. The hands-on support I’ve received has been invaluable. Whenever I’ve had questions, their customer support team has been prompt, knowledgeable, and always available to assist. It feels great knowing I have a solid partner in this space. The industry itself offers diverse opportunities, and through Jason's help, I now feel equipped to tackle these projects with confidence. The strategies and insights shared are far more comprehensive and strategic than anything I’ve experienced in the past. I’m excited about the FEMA contracts coming next year, and I’m optimistic about how they’ll further stabilize my business and provide new revenue streams. Overall, my experience has been highly positive and transformational. The flexibility of being able to adjust my retainer and consulting fees based on research has been crucial, allowing me to remain competitive. This is truly a long-term, sustainable business model that not only impacts my bottom line but also creates a positive ripple effect on my lifestyle and family. I’m incredibly grateful for the opportunity to work with GCAS and I look forward to what’s ahead. It’s been both rewarding and fulfilling to see the difference this has made in my business. Jason is on the clearest human beings I have ever met he is the epitome of credibility ,he went above and beyond to help me. Thank you, Jason, Robert, and the entire team!"

His teaching covered every essential aspect needed for success in government contracting, providing insights that are invaluable for anyone serious about this field. The depth of Jason’s expertise is unparalleled—imagine the cost of hiring a mentor with such extensive experience on a monthly basis! The return on investment from this course is exceptional. I gained critical knowledge on how small businesses can secure and thrive with government contracts, and in turn, make a significant positive impact on society. I wholeheartedly recommend this course to anyone looking to excel in government contracting. The value and expertise provided are simply unmatched. All the best,"

I have taken dozens of training courses over the years I found the this GCAS three-day course to be a game changer for me. Robert and Jason got straight to the point, no fluff or false expectations. Just raw knowledge, talent and experience that helped me get started the very first day after finishing the three-day workshop. I was amazed how much information they packed into 9 hours. The process was set forth systematically with a proven history that absolutely works. The day after taking the GCAS course I was on the phone negotiating with a John Deere dealership to supply the city of Juno Alaska with their heavy tractor equipment they need. Thanks again for putting me on the right track."

        "I took the GCAS course Jason & Robert teach. This was my first exposure to government contracting and to say I got a lot of information in their training is an understatement. I have taken various courses outside of Government Contracting such as marketing and lead generation over the years, but I always thought to myself, I wish I could have met them when they were just starting their training course so I could get a little more hands-on mentoring but that was never available, until now. The training is a lot of information, I personally was a bit overwhelmed in the beginning, but their support, their willingness to jump on the phone with you and take time with you to answer your questions is unlike anything I have ever experienced. The ability to get someone on the phone with 32 years experience in government contract consulting is worth 20X what they're charging for their training. I've never had the course creator's direct cell number where I could text questions or call them directly, but with Jason & Robert, I have always gotten a response and usually it's within 1 hour. There is a massive opportunity here for anyone willing to commit to studying and applying what is taught in the GCAS training & mentoring. Due to the recent hurricanes, there's going to be an enormous amount of government spending on these areas that were hit so hard. Opportunity is knocking, so if you've been looking for a business you can start that'll give you flexibility, and the ability to earn a very nice six-figure income, don't wait, take the leap and plug in, it might just be life changing!"
